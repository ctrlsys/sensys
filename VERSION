# greek is used for alpha or beta release tags.  If it is non-empty,
# it will be appended to the version number.  It does not have to be
# numeric.  Common examples include a1 (alpha release 1),
# b1 (beta release 1), sc2005 (Super Computing 2005 release).  The
# only requirement is that it must be entirely printable ASCII
# characters and have no white space.
