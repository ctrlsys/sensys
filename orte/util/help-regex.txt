[regex:special-char]
While trying to parse a regular expression to extract a list
of node names, the regex parser encountered a special character
at the beginning of the string:

    regexp: %s

We do not know how to parse this character - please contact the
Open MPI help list for assistance.

#
[regex:start-range-missing]
While trying to parse a regular expression to extract a list
of node names, the regex parser could not find the start of a range:

    regexp: %s

A range must start with a '[' - please contact the
Open MPI help list for assistance.

#
[regex:end-range-missing]
While trying to parse a regular expression to extract a list
of node names, the regex parser could not find the end of a range:

    regexp: %s

A range must end with a ']' - please contact the
Open MPI help list for assistance.

#
[regex:bad-value]
While trying to parse a regular expression to extract a list
of node names, the regex parser encountered a value it does
not know how to parse:

    regexp: %s

Please contact the Open MPI help list for assistance.

#
[regex:bad-ppn]
While trying to parse a regular expression to extract the number
of processes on each node, the regex parser encountered a value
it does not know how to parse:

    regexp: %s

Please contact the Open MPI help list for assistance.

#
[regex:num-digits-missing]
While trying to parse a regular expression to extract the node
names, the regex parser was unable to determine the number of
digits in the names:

   regexp: %s

Please contact the Open MPI help list for assistance.

#
[regex:consecutive-rightleft-brackets]
While trying to parse a regular expression to extract a list
of node names, the regex parser encountered consecutive right left brackets
in the string:

    regexp: %s

We do not know how to parse this character - please contact the
Open MPI help list for assistance.

#
[regex:no-base-range]
While trying to parse a regular expression to extract a list
of node names, the regex parser could not find the base of a range:

    regexp: %s

A range must have a base before '[' - please contact the
Open MPI help list for assistance.

#
[regex:num-digits-too-small]
While trying to parse a regular expression to extract a list
of node names, the regex parser found that the number of digits is too small:

    regexp: %s

A range's number of digits should be at least the same of the number of digits of the 
node that has the maximum number - please contact the
Open MPI help list for assistance.

#
[regex:range-left-bigger-right]
While trying to parse a regular expression to extract a list of node names, 
the regex parser found that the left value is bigger than the right one of a range:

    regexp: %s

A range's right value should be no less than the left value - please contact the
Open MPI help list for assistance.
